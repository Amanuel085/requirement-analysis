Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
Introduction
This repository is dedicated to exploring and documenting the Requirement Analysis phase within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It serves as a foundational resource for understanding how to gather, interpret, and manage software requirements effectively.
The goal is to break down key concepts, techniques, and tools used during requirement gathering, and to provide examples, templates, and reflections based on real-world scenarios. This is part of my learning journey in the Pro Front End Development track at ALX, where we emphasize building human-centric applications through thoughtful planning and execution.
